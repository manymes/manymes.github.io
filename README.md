=================

Manymes surfs independently on websites to disguise the users identity by creating data-trash. The respective topics are changeable by using a character-configurator. Each one of these character represents a topic and thus a certain number of search terms. In contrast to existing plugins like ghostery, users have the opportunity to fight active against tracking and unwanted cookies.
